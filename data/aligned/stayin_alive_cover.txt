You can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
But it's all right, it's ok
You can look the other way
You can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
See the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Heow, heow, heow, heow, we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Heow, heow, heow, heow, we're stayin' alive
We're stayin' alive
Well I get low and I get high
And if I don't, at least I try
Heaven's wings upon my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
Well it's all right, it's ok
I'll live to see another day
You can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
See the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Heow, heow, heow, heow, we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Heow, heow, heow, heow, we're stayin' alive
We're stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me yeah
We're stayin' alive
You can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And it's all right, it's ok
Live to see another day
You can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
See the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Heow, heow, heow, heow, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Heow, heow, heow, heow, stayin' alive
We're stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
We're stayin' alive
We're stayin' alive
We're stayin' alive
